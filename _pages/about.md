I am an Assistant Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering in the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) (UC). Prior to joining UC, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), Department of Computational Applied Mathematics & Operations Research, and a Visiting Postdoctoral Fellow at [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/), Department of Radiation Oncology. I hold a Ph.D. degree in Industrial Engineering from [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/). I am the recipient of the **2022 Pritsker Doctoral Dissertation Award** (2nd Place) from the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) and the **2020-2021 Outstanding Engineering Doctoral Student Award** from Texas A&M University.

**PS:** My official first name -- that appears on my publications -- is *Seyedmohammadhossein*,  which should actually be written *Seyed Mohammad Hossein*. The first word, *Seyed*, is a family prefix (not my name); my family and friends call me *Mohammad*.
